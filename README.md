# BMI Calculator

## Update:

I officially completed the Advanced JavaScript portion of The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, taught by Dr. Angela Yu. With that being said, I wanted to take some extra time to learn more and practice more JavaScript before I move on to JavaScript Frameworks. As a result, I have begun Udemy's, The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. I decided to take Jonas's Coding Challenges, personalize them, and practice/reinforce lessons I have learned.

## Description:

The first coding challenge was creating a BMI Calculator. While the original challenge requested, I take two sets of predetermined values, calculate the two BMI's, and then determine if the first BMI was more than the other BMI. The challenge requested I console log both BMI's and the Boolean stating if the statement was true or false. None of the above information would be displayed on the webpage and there was no way to change the values each time the function was ran without manually changing the values in the JavaScript file.

## What I changed:

I added a button titled "calculate" which provides the user a prompt requesting their name, their friend's name, as well as their separate weight and height. All values are stored and plugged into an equation that is formulated for imperial measurements. The BMI calculation are then compared using if else statements. The result replaces the h3 text content, with the person who has the higher BMI with a rounded BMI value.

## What I learned:

While this challenge is mainly a review for me, I did learn that modern JavaScript prefers "let" over "var", and that "var" is seen more in Legacy Code. Also "const" is used for variables that will not change. Jonas explained that using "const" as much as one can to prevent possible bugs in the future. Jonas explained that he would go into further detail between the two in future lessons. I also learned how to use Template Literals, of which I am very excited to use moving forward.
